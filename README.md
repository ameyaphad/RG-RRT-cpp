# Reachability-Guided Path Planner

Basic implementation of the Reachability-Guided RRT or RG-RRT motion planner for dynamic systems. In our implementation, we use a pendulum system and a simple car-like system to apply the RG-RRT algorithm on. This was implemented as part of the coursework assignment for the RBE 550 course taught at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).
